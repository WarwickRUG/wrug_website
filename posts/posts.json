Many modern commercial websites await\nuser input and/or display dynamic web content which is generated on the\nfly via JavaScript technologies. Standard techniques of web-scraping\nwhich are well-suited to collect information from static pages will fail\nin these instances. In such cases, it is necessary to automate the\nbrowser to visit websites, click buttons, and fill in forms by itself -\na task the tool Selenium fulfils. This talk will give a brief overview\nof approaches towards web scraping and an introduction to the R package\nRSelenium. The presentation will highlight use cases of RSelenium, show\nits potential, and give a starting point to those who have never used\nit.\nResources\nSlides\nR Markdown\nworkbook - HTML output\nR Markdown workbook - source\n\n\n\n",

You can run the\nenvironment on your local machine and both the instructions for creating\nthe environment and the environment itself can be shared. In this talk I\nwill (a) introduce containers, (b) discuss a worked examples of using\nDocker with R, and (c) consider how containers can help us do better\nresearch. Hopefully this presentation will help those of you who have\nnever used Docker to consider if you want to use Docker in your own work\nand where to start.\nResources\nSlides\nSource code\n\n\n\n",
