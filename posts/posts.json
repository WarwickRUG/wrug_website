In this talk I present our study which assessed the impact of\nCOVID-19 lockdowns in the first two years of the pandemic on household\nelectricity and gas use in England and Wales. I explain how I used R for\nthe machine learning and how I made the figures (see .Rmd file for\nfigure code).\nUsing data for 508 (electricity) and 326 (gas) homes, elastic net\nregression, neural network and extreme gradient boosting predictive\nmodels were trained and tested on pre-pandemic data. The most accurate\nmodel for each household was used to create counterfactuals (predictions\nin the absence of COVID-19) against which observed pandemic energy use\nwas compared. Our analysis showed that on average (electricity; gas)\nconsumption increased by (7.8%; 5.7%) in year 1 of the pandemic and by\n(2.2%; 0.2%) in year 2. The greatest increases were in the winter\nlockdown (January – March 2021) by 11.6% and 9.0% for electricity and\ngas, respectively. At the start of 2022 electricity use remained 2.0%\nhigher while gas use was around 1.9% lower than predicted. Households\nwith children showed the greatest increase in electricity consumption\nduring lockdowns, followed by those with adults in work. Wealthier\nhouseholds increased their electricity consumption by more than the less\nwealthy and continued to use more than predicted throughout the two-year\nperiod while the less wealthy returned to pre-pandemic or lower\nconsumption from summer 2021. Low dwelling efficiency was associated\nwith a greater increase in energy consumption during the pandemic.\nAdditionally, this study shows the value of different machine learning\ntechniques for counterfactual modelling at the individual-dwelling\nlevel, and our approach can be used to robustly estimate the impact of\nother events and interventions.\nResources\nSlides\nCode for figures\nJournal article: Zapata-Webborn, E et al (2023).

Many modern commercial websites await\nuser input and/or display dynamic web content which is generated on the\nfly via JavaScript technologies. Standard techniques of web-scraping\nwhich are well-suited to collect information from static pages will fail\nin these instances. In such cases, it is necessary to automate the\nbrowser to visit websites, click buttons, and fill in forms by itself -\na task the tool Selenium fulfils. This talk will give a brief overview\nof approaches towards web scraping and an introduction to the R package\nRSelenium. The presentation will highlight use cases of RSelenium, show\nits potential, and give a starting point to those who have never used\nit.\nResources\nSlides\nR Markdown\nworkbook - HTML output\nR Markdown workbook - source\n\n\n\n",

In this talk I\nwill (a) introduce containers, (b) discuss a worked examples of using\nDocker with R, and (c) consider how containers can help us do better\nresearch.
