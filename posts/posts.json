See full details below.\nSpeaker James Tripp, Senior Research Software\nEngineer, Information and Digital Group, University of Warwick\nAbstract Docker is a container technology which\nallows you to specify and build a compute environment. You can run the\nenvironment on your local machine and both the instructions for creating\nthe environment and the environment itself can be shared. In this talk I\nwill (a) introduce containers, (b) discuss a worked examples of using\nDocker with R, and (c) consider how containers can help us do better\nresearch. Hopefully this presentation will help those of you who have\nnever used Docker to consider if you want to use Docker in your own work\nand where to start.\nResources\nSlides\nSource code\n\n\n\n",
